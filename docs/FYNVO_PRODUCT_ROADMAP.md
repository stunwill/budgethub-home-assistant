# Fynvo Product Roadmap

This roadmap is the canonical development queue for Fynvo. Future development should update this file rather than creating parallel release plans.

## Product principles

1. Forecast actual dated cash flow, not just monthly averages.
2. Keep financial data local by default.
3. Separate budgeted, planned, actual and forecast financial activity.
4. Make scenario planning simple enough for everyday household use.
5. Keep financial calculations clear, auditable and explainable.
6. Support Australian household finance first while allowing later internationalisation.
7. Maintain a cohesive Fynvo visual and navigation system across future modules.
8. Make Budget, Actual, Committed, Planned, Forecast and Scenario explicit in budget analysis.
9. Make financial records maintainable after creation.
10. Feed Manual Entry, CSV Import and future CDR/Open Banking into one Actual transaction pipeline.
11. Keep spending intelligence local, explainable and user-controlled.
12. Treat Goals as forward-looking financial planning records distinct from Budgets and Planned Spending.
13. The Overview dashboard should be a household financial command centre, not a development-status page.
14. Authentication must always have a documented owner bootstrap and recovery path.
15. User activity, audit events and record change history must become explicit production-readiness capabilities before they are represented as delivered production features.
16. Financial Insights must be evidence-backed, consistent with source financial calculations and free from unsupported personal financial advice.
17. Fynvo must remain one responsive application across phone, tablet, desktop and Home Assistant ingress.
18. Stable-version work must prioritise reliability, data preservation and verifiable core workflows over new feature expansion.
19. Category identity and hierarchy must be authoritative, normalised and safe to reorganise without losing historical financial records.
20. Recurring definitions, forecast occurrences, commitments and actual transactions must remain distinguishable so future reconciliation can match records without duplicating obligations.

## Core product concepts

### Actual
Money that has already been received or spent through recorded, imported, synchronised or reconciled transactions.

### Committed
Known obligations and income sources such as recurring expenses, bills and scheduled income.

### Planned
Known or intended future spending that has not yet occurred.

### Budget
The amount the household intends or permits itself to spend for a category, period, account, person or goal.

### Goal
A desired future financial position or amount, such as a savings target, emergency fund, planned purchase, annual obligation or debt-reduction target.

### Forecast
What Fynvo calculates is likely to happen based on balances, commitments, plans, budgets where available and historical behaviour where appropriate.

### Scenario
A temporary or saved what-if view of what would happen if circumstances changed.

### Insight
An explainable signal derived from core Fynvo financial calculations. An Insight describes what changed or matters, its comparison basis, supporting evidence and a route to inspect the underlying records. Insights are not the source of financial truth.

### Audit Event
An append-only record of what action occurred, when it occurred and which user/interface caused it.

### Change History
A versioned view of what data changed on a financial record, such as amount, date, category or status.

## Release definition of done from v0.3.0 onward

Every release must include a version bump, database migrations where required, automated tests, CI validation, a CHANGELOG entry, Home Assistant-visible release notes, GitHub release notes and user-readable release notes.

Home Assistant ingress access, login, protected APIs, core create/edit persistence and safe upgrade behaviour are release blockers.

The v0.15.0 plan also proposed Home Assistant financial sensors/entities and automation actions. Those entities are not present in the actual merged repository and are therefore retained as future work rather than marked delivered.

- responsive mobile forms, tables, modals and dashboard/card layouts;
- tablet layout refinement and desktop sidebar preservation;
- responsive regression tests.

A real installed Home Assistant/iPhone acceptance run remains an operational acceptance requirement and is carried forward into v0.17.0 rather than being treated as automatically proven by source-level tests.

### v0.17.0 - Pre-v1.0 Reliability & Responsive Hardening

Status: Completed and merged.

Delivered scope:
- root-cause correction for the Accounts `+ Add` failure where the generic modal generated `PUT /api/accounts/null`;

- exact `Kristy - Main AC` Account create/edit regression coverage;
- generated Account ID, persistence and no-duplicate edit coverage;
- expanded friendly Account Types including Offset, Car Loan, Line of Credit, Investment and Superannuation, while retaining legacy `vehicle_loan` compatibility;
- explicit asset/liability Account classification;
- positive amount-owing UX for liability opening balances;
- Available Cash limited to active Transaction, Savings, Offset and Cash accounts;
- Account balance, cent-precision and transaction relationship regression coverage;
- liability-aware internal transfer semantics;
- archived-account write protection while retaining historical retrieval;
- user-facing validation messages for normal create/edit failures;
- Australian date-only display hardening;

- compact mobile Account/page actions and safer mobile modal action placement;
- v0.15 authentication regression preservation;
- v1.0 readiness assessment in `docs/V1_READINESS_v0.17.0.md`;
- release metadata, changelog and release-note updates.

### v0.17.4-v0.17.5 - Corrective Category and Mobile Workflow Releases

- removed the global date-range control from the Income page;
- improved corrective mobile layout and release regression coverage.

### v0.18.0 - Financial Data Integrity, Category Management & Workflow Polish

Status: In development.

Planned/implemented scope:
- authoritative Category-name normalisation across create and edit workflows, including case and repeated-whitespace duplicate prevention;
- user-supported Category merge preview and merge operations that reassign financial references and archive the source without deleting history;
- automatic consolidation of same-name child Categories when parent hierarchies are merged;
- Category health diagnostics covering duplicate groups, orphan children, inactive-parent relationships, cycles, orphan/inactive references, stale denormalised paths and Category-type conflicts;
- compact Category management UI with health checking, merge controls and reduced zero-entry visual noise;
- recurring-expense duplicate review based on normalised name, amount, frequency, payment source and due-date proximity, without automatic merging;
- Account/Card integrity diagnostics for orphan Cards and active Cards linked to archived Accounts;
- filtered Upcoming Commitments service foundation with explicit duplicate-suppression helper and overdue inclusion;
- continued reliance on the established linked Bill/Recurring Expense suppression in the schedule engine;
- compact mobile workflow refinements for Categories, Recurring Expenses and financial record tables;
- CI-equivalent local validation script to catch compile, Ruff, backend, frontend, metadata and Docker failures before PR creation;
- expanded regression coverage for Category duplicate prevention, merge data preservation, Category health, recurring duplicate review and commitment de-duplication;
- release metadata updated to v0.18.0.

Explicitly out of scope:
- direct ING connectivity;
- new production Open Banking/CDR provider integration;
- bank credential storage;
- standalone Cloudways migration.

Production CDR/provider work remains future scope. v0.18.0 prepares cleaner identities and data relationships without adding a bank-specific integration.

### v1.0.0 - Stable Production Release

Planned scope after the v0.18.0 acceptance gates pass:
- final acceptance QA of functionality already delivered;
- final v0.18-to-v1 upgrade/migration validation and representative older-data upgrade confirmation;
- backup and restore validation/documentation;
- final database integrity and recovery checks;
- final authentication/session/security review;
- Home Assistant ingress installation/onboarding validation;
- privacy, retention and safe diagnostic documentation for the functionality actually present;
- performance validation on representative household histories;
- final defects identified during acceptance;
- known-limitations documentation;
- production packaging, release notes and stable version tagging.

v1.0.0 must not become another large feature-expansion release. Capabilities not already dependable should remain explicitly future work rather than being added solely to satisfy the version number.

### Future Home Assistant Financial Integration

Planned scope retained because it is not present in the actual merged v0.16.0 source:
- Home Assistant financial sensors/entities;
- automation-friendly numeric financial state;
- dashboard cards;
- shortfall, upcoming bill, budget-risk, Insight and Goal automation foundations;
- sensor-friendly Financial Health component states;
- useful states such as available cash, forecast balance, lowest projected balance, overdue count, budget risk and Goal progress;
- Home Assistant notifications/actions that link back to Fynvo without duplicating core calculations;
- strict authentication/privacy boundary and no sensitive detail in entity attributes.

### Future Household Production Capabilities

These remain future capabilities and are not to be implied as v1.0.0-delivered unless separately implemented and validated:
- household user creation, editing, deactivation/reactivation and password-reset workflows;
- Administrator, Household Member and Read Only permissions;
- household membership/profile management;
- User Activity;
- immutable Audit Logs;
- per-record Change History;
- richer Reports and export-ready services;
- production CDR/provider expansion and consent lifecycle;
- advanced bank-sync retry/backoff and provider-degraded behaviour;
- broader privacy/data-retention controls;
- per-user Insight state when multi-user support is introduced.
